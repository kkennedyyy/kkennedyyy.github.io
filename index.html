           In order for the problem to be solved, we'll have to track the user to know their location
           to see if the building is handicap accessible or provides bike bars. The app should be easy to navigate and inform users who are
           handicapped of their rights in regards to public buildings. We also discussed how businesses will solve this problem, how long/costly construction
           may be, and different ways to protect users and their privacy.
