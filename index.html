           In order for the problem to be solved, we'll have to be able to track the user to know their location
           to see if It's handicap accesible and provides bike bars. The app should be easy to navigate and inform user's
           of handicap accesible laws. We also discussed how buisnesses will solve this problem, how long construction
           may be, and different ways to protect user's and their privacy.
