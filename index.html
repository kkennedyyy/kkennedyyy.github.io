           In order for the problem to be solved, we'll have to track the user to know their location
           to see if the building is handicap accesible or provides bike bars. The app should be easy to navigate and inform user's who are
           handicap, of their rights in regards to public buildings. We also discussed how: buisnesses will solve this problem, how long/costly construction
           may be, and different ways to protect user's and their privacy.
