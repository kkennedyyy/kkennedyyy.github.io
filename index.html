           In order for the problem to be solved, we'll have to track the user to know their location
           to see if the building is handicap accessible or provides bike bars. The app should be easy to navigate and inform users who are
           handicapped of their rights in regards to public buildings. We also discussed how businesses will solve this problem, how long/costly construction
           may be, and different ways to protect users and their privacy.

                    The app will include a home screen where the user is able to find accessible buildings or parking rails. The home screen will also
                 include a menu and profile button where the user can view their reviews, settings, etc. and profile. The app is intercative where 
                 user's are able to report hazards while in route and provide an update for the bike rails for other app user's to view. 
                 They'll also be able to submit verification of accessible buildings, routes, and rails to be approved.
